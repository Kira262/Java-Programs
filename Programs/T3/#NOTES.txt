Ch-6 RunTime Polymorphism and Exception Handling

Polymorphism:
2 Types=> 1)Compile Time 2)Run Time

Perform by:Method Over-loading & Method Over-riding

Run Time also called DMD -> Dynamic Method Dispatch


Upcasting and Down Casting:
-> Object can also be typecoated like data type.

2 Types=> 1)Parent Object 2)Child Object

2 Types of typecasting possible=> 1) Parent to Child(Down) 2) Child to Parent(Up) 

typecasting can be : -implicit & -explicit

Abstraction:
-> abstract keyword used to achieve Abstraction in java.
-> Only class and Method.
-> Abstract method must be implemented in child class.

-> Abstract method can only be in abstract class.
-> Abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract method.
-> Abstract class can have constructors.
-> Abstract class can have over-loaded methods.

-> Constructors can't be abstract.
-> Abstract class can't be instantiated.
-> Abstract method can't have body.


Interface in Java:
-> They are blueprint of a class.
-> Help to achieve abstraction & multiple inheritance.
-> It's not possible to create object of interface.
-> Interface can't have Constructors.
-> Interface can't have static block, instant block.

-> Methods in interface are by default : Public Abstract
-> Variables in interface are : public static final
-> Interfaces are created using "interface" keyword.
-> interface printt{
    int min=5;
    void printt();
}
interface printt{
    public static final int min=5;
public static final void printt();}


3 ways we can provide definition of a method in interface:1)Default 2)Static 3) Private

- default method: 
Defined using default keyword.
Only allowed in interface.
Default methods can be over-riden.
Default method have definitions. 

- Static method:
Can have definition in interface.
Can't be over-riden.
Can call static method using interface name.

- Private method:
Can have definition inside interface.
They are accessible inside interface only.
They can't be used by creating objects. 



EXception Handling in Java:
-> An event that disturbs the flow of the program.
-> Exception handling does not mean to repeat the program.
-> Default Exception handling is done by JVM.
-> When exception occurs the object is created using the following information:
1) Name of the exception.
2) Description of the exception.
3) Location of the  exception.

Exception heirarchy: Object -> Throwable
Types: 1) Exception 2) Error
